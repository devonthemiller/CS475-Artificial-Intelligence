To run program, enter the 'files' directory and type 'make' in the command line.
This should create a binary executable called 'game'. Run it using './game'.
The program should then prompt you to enter the filename corresponding to the
text file with the graph you want to test (remember to make sure that the file 
you give to the program is in the 'files' directory). Some sample test files 
should already be in the directory for you to use.

Also keep in mind that the program assumes that you are player 1, meaning
that you are assumed to make the first move.
